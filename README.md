The boys in C32 are at it again with another cool React App. 

Simply clone the repo and yarn start! however we are live at https://miamiridez.netlify.com/ - you will need to accept current location or have it enabled on your device as it's essential to the full functionality of our app. If you check us out live, make sure you give the page a quick refresh after accepting location permissions. 

The eMerge hackathon was a great learning experience, our future features hope to include ALL modes of public biking/scoooter transportation (such as Bird, Lime scooters, etc), a fully optimized search component for multiple city and keyword searches, as well as the ability to pull tweets based on your search criteria, searching for city + mode of transportation keyword (eg bike/scooter) + event - so that you can check out cool bike events in different cities such as Critical Mass. 

A simple app made with the purpose of bringing people together to enjoy everything we have to offer in Miami, and hopefully expanded to the rest of America and even europe, anywhere the data allows us to. 

Thanks for everything, Wyncode!
